# greaterjs
Replacing JavaScript's broken comparison operators.

/*
because we're greater than this.
npm module greater.js

the world always seems like they're moving too fast for me, so i like projects like this that help us qustion our assumptions and solidify our footing

null sql semantics

at 1:00 am i started seeing rochart charts

emit -1 for less-than (for sorting)

shadow-dom => select | greater => js_greater_than_operator


strings 'f', '0', 'false', 'no', and 'n' should be falsy, the rest should be truthy
arrays of length 0 should be falsy when compared with booleans
boolean 



bool < -- 0 == false, Infinity != false
true != -1, Infinity, MAX_VALUE
"0" == [], ['x'] == '1'
NaN should not equal things
objects -- deep equal
be more aggressive with gt and lt, not enough things are being compared
 t > f, t > 0, [] > f, [] > 'f' or [] > '0', 't' > 0, 't' > false, -- don't do this
  "1" "0" "-1" uncomparable?


  
  don't make js look better than it is

  the things people make fun of in js are {} + {} and similar type operations

  too much type-checking code, this allows you to use more objects in more common contexts

  primitives are everywhere, so why not make them behave how you want?



  nothing compares with NaN, numbers, everything not falsy is truthy


  bool undefined vs bool false.

 what would 140 Proof be without any proofs?

do it as part of your es6 upgrade

a fair amount of freedom in designing operator semantics
